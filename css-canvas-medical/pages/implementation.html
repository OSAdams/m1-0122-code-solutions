              <p>
                You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that<br>
                we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our<br>
                goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one<br>
                way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for<br>
                you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk<br>
                about their experience.

              <p>
                Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community<br>
                resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your<br>
                payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We&apos;ll<br>
                also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that<br>
                sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health<br>
                information exchanges or other infomration technology vendors are important, we<br>
                will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

              <p>
                The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which<br>
                we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on&dash;premise EMR<br>
                databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and<br>
                information like medications, prblems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.<br>
                While importing clinical notes and couments is more challenging, our team has<br>
                been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

              <p>
                We will work with your to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,<br>
                charge schedules, and much more. Role&dash;based trainings will be done a few weeks<br>
                prior to go&dash;live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice<br>
                management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go&dash;live, one of our<br>
                team can visit your practice to work side&dash;by&dash;side with you on implementation and<br>
                training.

              <p>
                Go&dash;live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be<br>
                with you, either in&dash;person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure<br>
                everything goes smoothly. THere is always fine tuning to do once you have a<br>
                handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates,<br>
                setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more.<br>
                We are here to help with it all.

              <p>
                All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide<br>
                suport over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not<br>
                metting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments<br>
                back. &lpar;We do not expect this to happen&rpar;. For our Standard plans, we also offer a<br>
                MIPS gaurantee&colon; if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for<br>
                everyone, we provide unlimited 24&#47;7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a<br>
                long, productive partnership for us both.
